== Description

https://wordnet.princeton.edu/documentation/wndb5wn

For each category, two files contain the data. For example, for nouns we have:

	index.noun
	data.noun


== Index file description

An index file is an alphabetized list of all the words found in WordNet. Each
line contains various columns separated by spaces:

lemma pos synset_cnt p_cnt [ptr_symbol...] sense_cnt tagsense_cnt synset_offset [synset_offset...]

   lemma
	Lower case ASCII text of word or collocation, 
	using underscores for collocations.

   pos
	Syntactic category: noun (n), verb (v), adjective (a) and adverb (r).

   synset_cnt
	Number of synsets that lemma is in (number of senses of the word in WordNet).
	Most frequent ones first.

   p_cnt
	Number of different pointers that lemma has in all synsets containing it.

   ptr_symbol
	A space separated list of p_cnt different types of pointers that lemma has
	in all synsets containing it. 
	See wninput(5WN) for a list of pointer_symbol s.
	If all senses of lemma have no pointers, this field is omitted and p_cnt is 0 .
	Some pointer symbols for nouns are
		@ hypernym
		~ hyponym

   sense_cnt
	Same as sense_cnt above (redundant, but kept for compatibility reasons).

   tagsense_cnt
	Number of senses of lemma that are ranked according to their frequency of
	occurrence in semantic concordance texts.

   synset_offset
	Byte offset in data.pos file of a synset containing lemma.
	Each synset_offset in the list corresponds to a different sense of lemma
	in WordNet. 
	This is an 8 digit, zero-filled decimal integer that can be used with fseek
	to read a synset from the data file.

Example:
	abducent n 1 1 @ 1 0 05486760  
	abducent_nerve n 1 1 @ 1 0 05486760  
	casuistry n 2 3 @ ~ + 2 0 06169960 06169771  

That is for WN.3.1 it is different for version 1.5, where the last one above is

	casuistry n 2 2 @ ~ 1 04097463 

Or look at the difference for casualty

	3.1	casualty n 4 3 @ ~ ; 4 0 09919234 09919123 07376317 07354694
	1.5	casualty n 3 2 @ ~ 3 05986904 04719021 04699226  


== Description of the data file (focusing at nouns)

Format:

synset_offset lex_filenum ss_type w_cnt [word lex_id]+ p_cnt [ptr...] [frames...] | gloss 

Example (line breaks added for readability):

	00001740 03 n 01 entity 0 003 ~ 00001930 n 0000 ~ 00002137 n 0000 ~ 04431553 n 0000 
	| that which is perceived or known or inferred to have its own distinct existence 
	(living or nonliving) 

Fields:

   synset_offset
	Current byte offset in the file represented as an 8 digit decimal integer.
	(This actually tends to point to the last character of the previous line)

   lex_filenum
	Two digit decimal integer corresponding to the lexicographer file name 
	containing the synset. See lexnames(5WN) (link is external) for the list
	of filenames and their corresponding numbers.

   ss_type
	The synset type: n, v, a, s (adjective satellite) or r
 
   w_cnt
	Two digit hexadecimal integer indicating the number of words in the synset.

   word
	ASCII form of a word as entered in the synset by the lexicographer, 
	with spaces replaced by underscore characters. The text of the word is 
	case sensitive, in contrast to its form in the corresponding index.pos file. 
	(Some marker is added for adjectives)

   lex_id
	One digit hexadecimal integer that, when appended onto lemma, uniquely 
	identifies a sense within a lexicographer file.

   p_cnt
	Three digit decimal integer indicating the number of pointers from this
	synset to other synsets. If p_cnt is 000 the synset has no pointers.

   ptr
	A pointer from this synset to another. ptr is of the form:

	   pointer_symbol synset_offset pos source/target 

	synset_offset is the byte offset of the target synset in the data file
	corresponding to pos.

	The source/target field distinguishes lexical and semantic pointers. 
	It is a four byte field, containing two two-digit hexadecimal integers. 
	The first two digits indicates the word number in the current (source) 
	synset, the last two digits indicate the word number in the target 
	synset. A value of 0000 means that pointer_symbol represents a 
	semantic relation between the current (source) synset and the target 
	synset indicated by synset_offset .

	A lexical relation between two words in different synsets is 
	represented by non-zero values in the source and target word numbers. 
	The first and last two bytes of this field indicate the word numbers 
	in the source and target synsets, respectively, between which the 
	relation holds. Word numbers are assigned to the word fields in a 
	synset, from left to right, beginning with 1.

   frames
	In data.verb only, a list of numbers corresponding to the generic verb 
	sentence frames for word s in the synset. frames is of the form:

	   f_cnt   +   f_num  w_num  [ +   f_num  w_num...] 

	For more information see 

	   https://wordnet.princeton.edu/documentation/wndb5wn

   gloss
	Each synset contains a gloss. A gloss is represented as a vertical bar,
	followed by a text string that continues until the end of the line. The
	gloss may contain a definition and/or example sentences.
